## Introduction

This project showcases two different neural network architectures:

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
2. **Transformer Networks**

Both models are used to predict house prices based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset from Kaggle. The data is divided into two parts:

1. `train.csv`: Training data containing 1460 rows and 81 columns.
2. `test.csv`: Testing data containing 1459 rows and 80 columns.

## Model Architecture

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The CNN model uses the following layers:

1. Input Layer
2. Embedding Layer
3. Multiple Convolutional and Pooling Layers
4. Global Average Pooling
5. Dense Layers
6. Output Layer

### Transformer Network

The Transformer model uses the following layers:

1. Input Layer
2. Embedding Layer
3. Transformer Blocks
4. Global Average Pooling
5. Dense Layers
6. Output Layer

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Code**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The script reads the data, builds the models, and evaluates their performance.

## Output

The output consists of the following:

1. **Model Summary**:
   - The summary of both the CNN and Transformer models.
2. **Training and Validation Loss**:
   - A plot showcasing the loss for both models during training and validation.
3. **Accuracy Comparison**:
   - A bar chart comparing the accuracy of the two models on the test set.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Graphviz
